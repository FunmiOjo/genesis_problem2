This application outputs the nth prime number.  It requires Python 3.  To calculate the 10,000th prime number
type the following commands in the command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/FunmiOjo/genesis_problem2.git
cd genesis_problem2
python3 get_nth_prime.py
```
When prompted, enter 10000.

# Extra credit
For any N over 100,000, I would consider changing my approach as calculating the Nth prime over this value would take at least several minutes if not hours.
